# Deep train
A repository for Pytorch-based deep learning training and testing that I've settled on over the years.
If I start a new deep learning-based project, I usually start from this repository.

## Features
- [x] Wandb logging
- [x] Slurm job submission via bash scripts
- [x] JSON-based configuration files with object parsing
